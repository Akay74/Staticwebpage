        <h2>WHAT IS DOG BREEDING</h2>
         <p>
    <b>Dog Breeding</b> is the practice of <a href="/wiki/Canine_reproduction">"Canine reproduction"</a>mating selected dogs with the intent to <mark>maintain or produce specific qualities and characteristics</mark>.
    When dogs reproduce without such human intervention, their offspring's characteristics are determined by <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>, while "dog breeding" refers specifically to the artificial selection of dogs,
    in which dogs are intentionally bred by their owners.
    Responsible <strong>Dog Breeding</strong> is no easy task. There are costs, effort and time to put in; but also big challenges to face.
    </p>
<p>However once you start, you get addicted. Breeding dogs is a wonderful journey and each puppy from each litter will hold a <b>special place in your heart</b></p>

<h2>BREEDING NATURALLY</h2>
<p>
For health and behavioral reasons, most authorities recommend that male dogs not be bred until they are at least 1½ years of age, and that female dogs not mate until they are on their second or third heat cycle. 
Certain health tests, including hip and elbow dysplasia screening by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, cannot be completed until a dog turns two.
</p>
<p>
Natural matings are usually conducted at the male dog's residence, because taking a male outside of his normal environment can cause insecurity and make his attention wander.
The dogs should be given a private enclosed area with good footing, preferably outside with weather permitting, where they can breed without distraction. Normally, only two handlers should be present, preferably the owners of each dog.
The mating process <strong>cannot be rushed</strong>. The dogs may need hours or days to become comfortable with each other; this can vary widely based on their experience, disposition and the timing of breeding attempts. Females should be showing obvious signs of estrus, 
including flirtation, flagging of her tail and twitching of her vulva. Males should be highly interested in the female, licking her vulva and attempting to mount her if she is ready and willing. The dogs should be supervised at all times to ensure their safety, usually on leash and with the female gently muzzled, 
especially if she is a virgin. Talking to the dogs in a soft, encouraging voice can help them feel secure and comfortable. They should never be hollered at out of the owner's frustration.
</p>
<p>
If a male is having difficulty with penetration, the female dog can be gently moved into place in front of him. A small dab of lubrication, such as K-Y Jelly, on the female's vulva may help, but physical manipulation of the male's genitalia normally does not.
When an inside tie happens, the male will slide his front legs off one side of the female and usually lift one hind leg over her back, so that the two are standing rear-to-rear.
At this time, they are attached, or "tied," by the male's penis swelling up inside and being held by the muscles in the female's vagina. They can stay tied for a long time, with the average being 15 to 45 minutes in most breeds.
Virgin females usually vocalize during the first part of the tie and may need extra comforting and restraint. It is extremely dangerous if the dogs try to separate during a tie before they are physically capable of doing so. Afterwards, the female should not be allowed to urinate for 15 minutes.
The male should be walked until he no longer has an erection and his penis is no longer visible.

<h2 id="h2">18 Tips for First-Time Breeders</h2>
<p>For the first-time breeder, it's crucial to prepare as thoroughly as you can for that first litter.</p>
<br>
<p>
  Breeding a litter is a rewarding and challenging experience. It is also a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes heartbreaking endeavor. 
  It takes real commitment on the part of bitch owner combined with lots of patience, money, and months (or even years) of careful planning and organization before a breeding should even take place.
</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some important tips for first-time breeders:</p>
<br>
<ul id="mylist">
   <li>Begin by educating yourself about the breed, dog breeding, and the AKC breed standard (read, read, read).</li>
   <li>Don't rush to breed your bitch. Let her grow up first, and have her health certifications completed after the age of 24 months.</li>
   <li>Have your veterinarian give your bitch a thorough examination, including a fecal check, prior to having her bred, and make sure vaccinations are current.</li>
   <li>Talk to your breeder about breeding your bitch, and get his or her opinion as you start your search early for a "perfect male" who complements her.
     Also consult with other longtime, successful breeders. Look at conformation, temperament, and health of potential stud dogs, and research several generations back.
     Study any progeny, and confirm health histories.
    </li>
    <li>Once you have picked your potential stud, select a "backup" male in the event that your first-choice dog becomes unavailable.</li>
    <li>Finalize the stud contract, clearly stating all terms and obligations.</li>
    <li>Begin developing your own contract of sale. For help in this, ask other breeders if they would share samples of their contracts.</li>
    <li>
      Start an advertising campaign well ahead of the breeding to let people know about the planned litter.
      This may include taking an ad out in a breed publication and designing or updating a website that posts a puppy-buyer application, pedigrees, and photos of the sire and dam, along with AKC registration and health information.
    </li>
    <li>Once your bitch comes in season, begin progesterone testing to determine the optimal time for her to be bred.</li>
    <li>Feed your pregnant bitch a high-quality dog food, and exercise her daily so she is in good condition to whelp.</li>
    <li>Prepare a whelping box large enough to comfortably accommodate your bitch and her new offspring.</li>
    <li>Have on hand plenty of towels (large and small) and blankets (or newspapers) for the whelping box.</li>
    <li>
      Once your bitch is bred, decide whether or not you will have an ultrasound done to confirm pregnancy.
      Notify your veterinarian of the due date, and discuss with her when to take the mother dog in for an X-ray a few days prior to the whelping date so as to get an approximation of how many puppies to expect.
    </li>
    <li>Prepare your whelping supplies to include thermometer, stethoscope, gloves, hemostat, bulb syringe, disinfectant, charts to record details about the pups at birth (with places to indicate each one's weight, sex, and color)—and, of course, lots of coffee and snacks.</li>
    <li>Arrange for an experienced dog person to assist you during the whelping, ideally someone who can come on a moment's notice.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have extra cash saved up in case there are complications during pregnancy or whelping. Money will also be needed for puppy exams and vaccinations.</li>
    <li>No matter how prepared you think you are, things do not always go as planned. Keep emergency numbers handy (veterinarian, emergency animal hospital, your breeder, and so on).</li>
</ul>

</br>

<p>Finally, get as much sleep as possible the week before the blessed event, since you won't get any once your bitch whelps.</p>

</br>
<p>
  Successful breeders will tell you that breeding a quality litter isn't easy. 
  Puppies are such a joy, but a lot of research, hard work, financial commitment, 
  and preparation on the breeder's part are required to ensure that the dam and litter
  are healthy and happy and that the pups will grow to be outstanding representatives of the breed.
